# Text2SQL Data Adapter

Text2sql data adapter preprocess the text2sql datasets in a similar way as [rasat](https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/rasat).

This data preprocess features a schema serialization step.

The original schema is extracted from a SQLSplite3 database and takes the form of a json dict.

The json dict is then serialized in a linear form.
